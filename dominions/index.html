            <summary>Arcoscephale — Golden Age of Man</summary>
            <div class="dossier-body">
              <p>"Arcoscephale is a Hellenic realm of city-states where oracles, philosophers, and the legacies of the Cyclopes guide a dawning Golden Age of Man."</p>

              <h4>Troops and commanders</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Militia, Light Infantry, and Peltasts</strong>: inexpensive line holders and flankers with javelins and shields.</li>
                <li><strong>Hoplites and Hypaspists</strong>: disciplined spear infantry with bronze armor; Hypaspists bring higher morale and attack skill.</li>
                <li><strong>Charioteers</strong>: trampling chariots for early expansion against light or medium infantry.</li>
                <li><strong>Elephants</strong>: high-impact tramplers that clear indie lines when backed by morale buffs.</li>
                <li><strong>Sacred Heart Companions</strong>: capital-only sacred heavy cavalry with lances and good morale.</li>
                <li><strong>Scout and Assassin</strong>: stealth tools for early map control and pickoffs.</li>
                <li><strong>Oread</strong>: capital-only N3 mage with nature/earth randoms; stealthy, can cloud trapeze later.</li>
                <li><strong>Hiereia</strong>: H1 priestess with nature randoms, often your stealthy bless carrier for sacreds.</li>
                <li><strong>Mystic</strong>: versatile researcher with S2 base and fire/air/earth/water randoms; cornerstone of communions.</li>
                <li><strong>Philosopher</strong>: cheap researcher with inspiring research; ideal for early lab stacking.</li>
                <li><strong>Archon/Strategos</strong>: leadership commanders for expansion parties and early thugs with buffs.</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>Notable strengths</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Diverse elemental access through Mystics, enabling early communions and flexible battlefield magic.</li>
                <li>Cheap research via Philosophers accelerates your early tech curve.</li>
                <li>Strong expanders with elephants, chariots, and sacred cavalry supported by basic buffs.</li>
                <li>Stealth access (Oreads and Hiereiai) for surprise raiding or remote blessing.</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>Quick guide</h4>
              <p>Open with Philosopher spam to push research, recruit a mix of Mystics and a few Hiereiai, and expand using elephants or chariots screened by hoplites. A moderate bless (morale/attack or reinvigoration) keeps Heart Companions and Hypaspists reliable. Early research goals: Alteration 3 (Luck/Body Ethereal), Conjuration 3–5 for Summon Earthpower and lesser elementals, and Construction 4 for Owl Quills and Lightless Lanterns. In wars, lean on Mystic communions for buffs (Protection, Strength of Giants) and battlefield control (Sleep Cloud, Stellar Cascades), while stealth Oreads set up surprise raids or cloud-trapeze thugs later.</p>

            <summary>Mekone — City of Iron and Bronze</summary>
            <div class="dossier-body">
              <p>"Mekone is a fortress-realm of iron-willed Gigantes whose stratified city-state mixes Cyclopean craft, hoplite drill, and stern oracles of the mountain."</p>

              <h4>Troops and commanders</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Gigante Hoplites and Iron Guards</strong>: size-4 spear infantry with tower shields and heavy armor; Iron Guards are elite bodyguards with higher morale and protection.</li>
                <li><strong>Gigante Slingers and Javeliniers</strong>: ranged support that soaks arrows and chips at lines while giants advance.</li>
                <li><strong>Automaton Hoplites</strong>: mindless bronze constructs that never rout, excellent for holding a flank under arrow fire.</li>
                <li><strong>Gigante Polemarch and Strategos</strong>: giant leaders that can thug with basic buffs and anchor expansion parties.</li>
                <li><strong>Iron Priest</strong>: H1/E1 mage-priests who bless, cast Strength of Giants, and provide earth utility.</li>
                <li><strong>Oracles of the Ancestors</strong>: cap-only E2S2 mages with astral/earth randoms; communion leaders and late-game ritualists.</li>
                <li><strong>Oneiropompus</strong>: stealthy dream-guides with astral and death randoms for remote site searching and skelly spam.</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>Notable strengths</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Elite giant infantry that trades well into most indies and early neighbors when properly buffed.</li>
                <li>Reliable earth/astral core enabling communions, Strength of Giants, Legions of Steel, and early construction rushes.</li>
                <li>Construct troops that do not rout, allowing stubborn hold points while giants maneuver.</li>
                <li>Cap-only Oracles provide strong research and scale into mid-game battlefield magic.</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>Quick guide</h4>
              <p>Lead expansion with 2–3 Gigante Hoplites plus an Iron Priest casting Bless and Strength of Giants; add Automaton anchors against heavy archers. Prioritize a minor earth/defense bless to boost protection and fatigue relief for size-4 lines. Research goals: Construction 2–4 for Owl Quills, Dwarven Hammers, and basic thug kits; Alteration 3 for Body Ethereal/Iron Skin on polemarch thugs; Enchantment 3–4 for Strength of Giants and Legions of Steel. Use Oracles to build communions that drop battlefield-wide buffs while Oneiropompi scout and raid with skeletons behind enemy lines.</p>

            <div class="dossier-body">
              <p>"Pangaea is an untamed forest kingdom where satyrs, maenads, and horned beastmen heed the call of revelry, raiding, and the whispering Pans."</p>

              <h4>Troops and commanders</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Satyr Hoplites and Centaur Warriors</strong>: solid line troops and fast flankers; centaurs bring high attack and mobility.</li>
                <li><strong>Maenads</strong>: free unrest-driven chaff that soaks arrows and ties down enemy lines.</li>
                <li><strong>Minotaurs and Minotaur Lords</strong>: trampling shock infantry with high strength and berserk potential.</li>
                <li><strong>Centaur Archers</strong>: excellent early-game archers with precision and mobility.</li>
                <li><strong>White Centaurs</strong>: capital-only sacred heavy cavalry with two hoof attacks and high stats.</li>
                <li><strong>Dryad and Satyr Scouts</strong>: stealthy leaders for raiding parties and province defense disruption.</li>
                <li><strong>Pan</strong>: cap-only N3H2 mage-priests with strong nature paths and randoms; summon satyrs and cast buffs.</li>
                <li><strong>Pans of the Wild</strong>: nature mages with blood randoms for early blood hunting and sabbath support.</li>
              </ul>

                <li>Powerful nature magic from Pans for buffs (Protection, Wooden Warriors) and summons.</li>
                <li>Access to blood enables mid-game sabbaths and demons if desired.</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>Quick guide</h4>
              <p>Expand with mixed Satyr Hoplites and Centaur Archers led by a Pan casting Protection and Bless on White Centaur anchors. Favor a minor attack skill/reinvigoration bless to keep sacreds lethal and fresh. Research Alteration 3 for Wooden Warriors, Enchantment 3 for Swarm, and Construction 4 for Thistle Maces. Begin blood hunting with Pans of the Wild once you stabilize dominion, and use stealth Dryads to lead maenad-heavy raiding parties that torch enemy provinces.</p>

              <p>"Ermor of the Early Age is a disciplined republic whose augurs and legions uphold the Old Faith while probing the stars and shades for power."</p>

              <h4>Quick guide</h4>
              <p>Open with a line of Hastati backed by Principes and a few Equites on the flanks; add Gladiators for high-damage strikes when facing heavy infantry. A modest attack skill/defense bless keeps Sacred Velites effective without heavy investment. Push Alteration 3 for Body Ethereal/Protection on communion masters and Enchantment 3 for Strength of Giants plus early banishment tools. Use Augur Elder communions to spam Paralyze and Soul Slay in fights, while Pontifices preach and lead sieges with formation-fighting legions.</p>
