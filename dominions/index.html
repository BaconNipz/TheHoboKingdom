            <summary>Arcoscephale — Golden Age of Man</summary>
            <div class="dossier-body">
              <p>"Arcoscephale is a Hellenic realm of city-states where oracles, philosophers, and the legacies of the Cyclopes guide a dawning Golden Age of Man."</p>

              <h4>Troops and commanders</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Militia, Light Infantry, and Peltasts</strong>: inexpensive line holders and flankers with javelins and shields.</li>
                <li><strong>Hoplites and Hypaspists</strong>: disciplined spear infantry with bronze armor; Hypaspists bring higher morale and attack skill.</li>
                <li><strong>Charioteers</strong>: trampling chariots for early expansion against light or medium infantry.</li>
                <li><strong>Elephants</strong>: high-impact tramplers that clear indie lines when backed by morale buffs.</li>
                <li><strong>Sacred Heart Companions</strong>: capital-only sacred heavy cavalry with lances and good morale.</li>
                <li><strong>Scout and Assassin</strong>: stealth tools for early map control and pickoffs.</li>
                <li><strong>Oread</strong>: capital-only N3 mage with nature/earth randoms; stealthy, can cloud trapeze later.</li>
                <li><strong>Hiereia</strong>: H1 priestess with nature randoms, often your stealthy bless carrier for sacreds.</li>
                <li><strong>Mystic</strong>: versatile researcher with S2 base and fire/air/earth/water randoms; cornerstone of communions.</li>
                <li><strong>Philosopher</strong>: cheap researcher with inspiring research; ideal for early lab stacking.</li>
                <li><strong>Archon/Strategos</strong>: leadership commanders for expansion parties and early thugs with buffs.</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>Notable strengths</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Diverse elemental access through Mystics, enabling early communions and flexible battlefield magic.</li>
                <li>Cheap research via Philosophers accelerates your early tech curve.</li>
                <li>Strong expanders with elephants, chariots, and sacred cavalry supported by basic buffs.</li>
                <li>Stealth access (Oreads and Hiereiai) for surprise raiding or remote blessing.</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>Quick guide</h4>
              <p>Open with Philosopher spam to push research, recruit a mix of Mystics and a few Hiereiai, and expand using elephants or chariots screened by hoplites. A moderate bless (morale/attack or reinvigoration) keeps Heart Companions and Hypaspists reliable. Early research goals: Alteration 3 (Luck/Body Ethereal), Conjuration 3–5 for Summon Earthpower and lesser elementals, and Construction 4 for Owl Quills and Lightless Lanterns. In wars, lean on Mystic communions for buffs (Protection, Strength of Giants) and battlefield control (Sleep Cloud, Stellar Cascades), while stealth Oreads set up surprise raids or cloud-trapeze thugs later.</p>

            <summary>Mekone — City of Iron and Bronze</summary>
            <div class="dossier-body">
              <p>"Mekone is a polis of Gigantes who still remember the Titans. Tower shields, bronze panoplies, and Cyclopean craft of mindless automatons keep the mountain city secure."</p>

              <h4>Troops and commanders</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Gigante Hoplites</strong>: size-4 spear infantry with tower shields and bronze cuirasses that form the backbone of expansion parties.</li>
                <li><strong>Automaton Hoplites</strong>: bronze constructs that never rout and hold a flank while living giants maneuver.</li>
                <li><strong>Gigante Slinger and Gigante Javelinier</strong>: missile support that soaks return fire thanks to high hit points.</li>
                <li><strong>Iron Guard</strong>: elite bodyguards with higher protection and morale than regular hoplites.</li>
                <li><strong>Gigante Polemarch and Strategos</strong>: giant leaders for armies and early thugs once basic earth buffs are online.</li>
                <li><strong>Iron Priest</strong>: E1H1 mage-priests who bless sacreds and cast early earth buffs such as Strength of Giants.</li>
                <li><strong>Oracle of the Ancestors</strong>: cap-only E2S2 researchers with earth/astral randoms that serve as communion leaders.</li>
                <li><strong>Oneiropompus</strong>: stealthy astral mages with death randoms suited for remote site-searching and skeleton spam.</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>Notable strengths</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>High-protection giant infantry supported by earth buffs trades well into most independents.</li>
                <li>Automatons provide fearless anchors that ignore morale and rout.</li>
                <li>Strong earth/astral access through Oracles enables communions and construction rushes.</li>
                <li>Stealthy Oneiropompi give early remote search and raiding options.</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>Quick guide</h4>
              <p>Expand with Gigante Hoplites led by an Iron Priest casting Bless and Strength of Giants, adding Automaton Hoplites against arrow-heavy provinces. A minor earth bless (reinvigoration or protection) keeps size-4 troops steady. Research Construction 2–4 for Owl Quills and simple thug gear, Alteration 3 for Body Ethereal/Iron Skin on Polemarch thugs, and Enchantment 3–4 for Strength of Giants and Legions of Steel. Use Oracle communions for battlefield buffs while Oneiropompi scout and raid with skeletons.</p>

            <summary>Pangaea — Revels of the Wild</summary>
            <div class="dossier-body">
              <p>"Pangaea is a woodland realm of satyrs, maenads, and horned beastmen gathered by the revels of the Pans."</p>

              <h4>Troops and commanders</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Satyr Hoplites</strong>: spear infantry with shields; cheap line troops for early expansion.</li>
                <li><strong>Centaur Warriors and Centaur Archers</strong>: fast flankers and accurate archers that hit hard in the early game.</li>
                <li><strong>Maenads</strong>: free-spawning berserk chaff produced in turmoil that soaks arrows and ties down enemy lines.</li>
                <li><strong>Minotaurs</strong>: trampling shock infantry with high strength and berserk, available as troops and as Minotaur Lords.</li>
                <li><strong>White Centaurs</strong>: capital-only sacred heavy cavalry with multiple hoof attacks and good protection.</li>
                <li><strong>Dryad and Satyr Scout</strong>: stealthy leaders for raiding parties and unrest generation.</li>
                <li><strong>Pan</strong>: cap-only N3H2 mage-priests with nature randoms for buffs and summons.</li>
                <li><strong>Pan of the Wild</strong>: nature mages with blood randoms that can start early blood hunting and support sabbaths.</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>Notable strengths</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Free maenad chaff provides numbers, archer soak, and siege bonus in turmoil.</li>
                <li>Fast and accurate centaur archers dominate many early indie fights.</li>
                <li>Strong nature magic for buffs like Protection and Wooden Warriors plus access to Swarm.</li>
                <li>Blood access through Pans of the Wild opens sabbaths and demon summons.</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>Quick guide</h4>
              <p>Use Satyr Hoplites to hold the line while Centaur Archers fire and White Centaurs anchor sacred expansion under a simple attack/reinvigoration bless. A Pan casting Protection and Swarm dramatically improves early fights. Research Alteration 3 for Wooden Warriors, Enchantment 3 for Swarm, and Construction 4 for Thistle Maces. Start blood hunting with Pans of the Wild in safe provinces and lead maenad-heavy stealth raids with Dryads to punish enemy backlines.</p>

            <summary>Ermor — Legions of the Old Faith</summary>
            <div class="dossier-body">
              <p>"Early Ermor is the disciplined republic of the Old Faith. Augurs consult the stars and shades while citizen legions march behind heavy shields and pila."</p>

              <h4>Troops and commanders</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Hastatus, Princeps, and Triarius</strong>: Roman infantry with formation fighter and pilum volleys; Triarii are elite spear lines with high protection.</li>
                <li><strong>Eques and Equite Extraordinarius</strong>: fast cavalry flankers; Extraordinarii have better armor and morale.</li>
                <li><strong>Gladiator</strong>: one-battle, high-damage units used to crack thugs or early forts.</li>
                <li><strong>Velite</strong>: javelin skirmishers; the sacred <em>Velite Warrior</em> variant is capital-only.</li>
                <li><strong>Augur and Augur Elder</strong>: astral/death priests (S1D1 and S2D2) that research well and form communions.</li>
                <li><strong>Pontifex</strong>: H3 astral leaders who preach, bless, and provide strong leadership for legions.</li>
                <li><strong>Legatus Legionis</strong>: inspiring commanders with formation fighter leadership bonuses.</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>Notable strengths</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Disciplined infantry with formation fighter trades efficiently and holds lines.</li>
                <li>Astral/death priesthood enables communions for Paralyze, Soul Slay, and Banishment.</li>
                <li>Accessible sacred Velite Warriors work with inexpensive blesses.</li>
                <li>Gladiators offer powerful one-shot damage for sieges or tough indie fights.</li>

              <h4>Quick guide</h4>
              <p>Expand with Hastati backed by Principes and Equites on the flanks; add Gladiators when facing heavy armor. A modest attack/defense bless keeps Velite Warriors effective without heavy investment. Research Alteration 3 for Body Ethereal and Protection on communion masters, then Enchantment 3 for Strength of Giants and early banishment. Use Augur Elder communions to spam Paralyze and Soul Slay while Pontifices preach and lead sieges with formation-fighting legions.</p>
