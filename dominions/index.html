      </div>The kingdom of Arcoscephale is yet to be founded and in its place is a loose collection of city states. Bronze is more common than iron and hoplites have yet to see the light of day. Instead, myrmidons and chariots compose the core of the armies. In this time, slaves are commonly used and most free men have plenty of time to spend on fine arts and good living. Philosophers gather in the cities to discuss esoteric truths and engineers manufacture clever contraptions for civil or military use. At the heart of Arcoscephale lies Mount Cephalos, abode of the Awakening God. At the foot of the mountain is a great temple where sacred Pegasus Riders are trained. Icarids, men with mechanical wings, are also used in warfare. The philosophers are better at magical research in a slothful Dominion.

"Arcoscephale is together with Pythium the first nation conceived in the creation of Dominions. After having played GMT's Great Battles of Alexander and S.P.Q.R. I got fascinated by ancient warfare, and the hoplites were among the first units to appear in Dominions. At first the two nations were one, with a troop rooster of ancient units, while Man and later on Ulm had troop roosters with a more medieval touch. Soon, however, it became clear that Pythium and Arcoscephale should be two distinct nations. Arcoscephale is heavily influenced by ancient Greek city states and Hellas. The Golden Age is influenced by the mythical past and the archaic age. Later ages boast Hellenic and Mesopotamian influences: elephants, mysteries and Chaldean astrologers." -Illwinter</div>

              <h4>Troops and commanders</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Militia, Light Infantry, and Peltasts</strong>: inexpensive line holders and flankers with javelins and shields.</li>
                <li><strong>Hoplites and Hypaspists</strong>: disciplined spear infantry with bronze armor; Hypaspists bring higher morale and attack skill.</li>
                <li><strong>Charioteers</strong>: trampling chariots for early expansion against light or medium infantry.</li>
                <li><strong>Elephants</strong>: high-impact tramplers that clear indie lines when backed by morale buffs.</li>
                <li><strong>Sacred Heart Companions</strong>: capital-only sacred heavy cavalry with lances and good morale.</li>
                <li><strong>Scout and Assassin</strong>: stealth tools for early map control and pickoffs.</li>
                <li><strong>Oread</strong>: capital-only N3 mage with nature/earth randoms; stealthy, can cloud trapeze later.</li>
                <li><strong>Hiereia</strong>: H1 priestess with nature randoms, often your stealthy bless carrier for sacreds.</li>
                <li><strong>Mystic</strong>: versatile researcher with S2 base and fire/air/earth/water randoms; cornerstone of communions.</li>
                <li><strong>Philosopher</strong>: cheap researcher with inspiring research; ideal for early lab stacking.</li>
                <li><strong>Archon/Strategos</strong>: leadership commanders for expansion parties and early thugs with buffs.</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>Notable strengths</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Diverse elemental access through Mystics, enabling early communions and flexible battlefield magic.</li>
                <li>Cheap research via Philosophers accelerates your early tech curve.</li>
                <li>Strong expanders with elephants, chariots, and sacred cavalry supported by basic buffs.</li>
                <li>Stealth access (Oreads and Hiereiai) for surprise raiding or remote blessing.</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>Quick guide</h4>
              <p>Open with Philosopher spam to push research, recruit a mix of Mystics and a few Hiereiai, and expand using elephants or chariots screened by hoplites. A moderate bless (morale/attack or reinvigoration) keeps Heart Companions and Hypaspists reliable. Early research goals: Alteration 3 (Luck/Body Ethereal), Conjuration 3–5 for Summon Earthpower and lesser elementals, and Construction 4 for Owl Quills and Lightless Lanterns. In wars, lean on Mystic communions for buffs (Protection, Strength of Giants) and battlefield control (Sleep Cloud, Stellar Cascades), while stealth Oreads set up surprise raids or cloud-trapeze thugs later.</p>
